# NC - News React App

This is the frontend for the NC-News Postgres database backend linked below. It provides a reddit style interface with a range of topics, articles and comments. Users are able to browse through articles, filtering by topic. Users can post comments, vote on articles and comments, and delete articles and comments they themselves have posted.

## Important information

Deployed app: https://nc-news-15da4.web.app/
Backend Repo: https://github.com/Sam-Mod23/be-nc-news

Node version v15.6.0 and above required.

## How to run project locally

Fork the git repo linked above

In terminal, input "git clone _your forked git repo link_"

"npm install" to install all dependencies and packages

Run the npm start script shown below.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
